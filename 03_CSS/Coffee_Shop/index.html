        <h1>Discover the World of Coffee</h1>
        <p>Coffee, a beloved beverage enjoyed by millions around the globe, is derived from the roasted seeds of the Coffea plant, known as coffee beans. These beans are the core of a complex and rich industry that spans continents, cultures, and centuries. Coffee's origins trace back to the ancient coffee forests of Ethiopia, where legend suggests that goat herders first noticed the energizing effects of coffee beans. From these humble beginnings, coffee cultivation and trade spread to the Arabian Peninsula, where it became deeply embedded in the culture and daily life.There are two main species of coffee plants cultivated for consumption: Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora, commonly known as Arabica and Robusta, respectively. Arabica beans, which account for about 60-70% of the world's coffee production, are prized for their sweet, soft taste and intricate flavor profiles that can include notes of fruit, sugar, and berries. The journey from coffee bean to cup involves several intricate steps, each contributing to the final flavor and quality of the beverage. Once harvested, coffee beans undergo processing to remove the outer fruit layers</p>

        <h1>The Origins of Coffee</h1>
        <p id="p1">The story of coffee begins in the ancient coffee forests of Ethiopia. According to legend, the energizing effects of coffee were discovered by a goat herder named Kaldi in the 9th century. Kaldi observed that his goats became particularly lively after eating the red berries from a certain tree. Curious about this phenomenon, Kaldi tried the berries himself and experienced a similar boost in energy.</p>
        <p>Kaldi shared his discovery with a local monastery, where the monks decided to try the berries. They found that the berries helped them stay awake and alert during long hours of prayer. As the news of these miraculous berries spread, the knowledge of coffee began to take root and grow.</p>

                    <h3>Espresso</h3>
                    <p>Espresso is made by forcing nearly boiling water through finely-ground coffee beans, which results in a concentrated, syrup-like coffee drink. This is the base for many Italian beverages in coffee shops. When compared to regular brewed coffee, espresso is much stronger than the other types of coffee drinks. Espressos are enjoyed in shots where a single shot is one ounce and a long (single and double) shot is two ounces in amount, respectively.</p>

                    <p>A latte is an espresso with steamed milk and a dollop of milk foam on top. This beverage is more prevalent in America than other coffee drinks like cappuccinos because it contains less foam, making it smoother and gentler for those with sensitive palettes. And if you want to spice up your latte, add some flavouring syrup. To make an iced version of this drink, simply pour espresso and steamed milk over ice cubes.</p>

                    <p>Black coffee is arguably the most common type of coffee drink out there. Its popularity can be mainly attributed to how easy it is to make this beverage, be it drip, pour-over, French press, or anything else. Black coffee is usually served with no add-ins.</p>

                    <p>Coffee and chocolate are two of the best things in the world. Mochas are espresso-based drinks made with chocolate and whipped cream instead of foam, so you get the best of both worlds in every sip. Their ratio depends on what you prefer; whether you want more coffee or chocolate, your mocha will shine in any coffee shop.</p>

The name came about during World War II when European baristas added water to their espresso drinks for the American soldiers stationed there. The resulting drink had a smoother, less concentrated flavour than espresso and thus the Americano was born.</p>

                    <p>Cappuccinos are a classic Italian type of coffee drink made of espresso, steamed milk, and thick foam in equal parts. The name comes from the resemblance to the hoods worn by Capuchin monks. Making cappuccino is relatively easy and can be done at home too if you know how to make espresso.</p>
