            <p class="fs-5">An online bank is a financial institution that operates primarily through the internet rather than through physical branch locations. This model of banking leverages modern technology to offer a wide range of banking services that can be accessed through a web browser or a mobile app, providing customers with convenience, efficiency, and often lower fees.Online banking has evolved significantly since its inception in the late 20th century. Initially, it began with basic functionalities like viewing account balances and statements. Over time, as internet technology advanced and consumer trust grew, online banking services expanded to include more complex transactions such as bill payments, fund transfers, and loan applications. Today, online banking encompasses a wide array of financial services, fully integrating into the daily lives of consumers. This evolution has been driven by the need for convenience, the advancements in cybersecurity, and the increasing use of smartphones and mobile apps.</p>
